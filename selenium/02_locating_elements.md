# Locating elements
One of the most fundamental techniques to learn when using WebDriver is how to find elements on the page. WebDriver offers a number of built-in selector types.


## WebDriver
To start searching an element or elements we start always with the driver.  
example:  

```
driver.find_element()  
driver.find_elements()
```
