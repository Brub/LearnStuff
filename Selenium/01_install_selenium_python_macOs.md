# Info
It's best to keep all installation of a python project in a sererate environment.

## 1. Create an environment

` python3 -m venv venv`

## 2. Activate the environment

`source venv/bin/activate`

## 3. Installation of Selenium libraries for Python

`pip install selenium`

## 4. Installing WebDriver binaries
Through WebDriver, Selenium supports all major browsers on the market such as Chrom(ium), Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari. Where possible, WebDriver drives the browser using the browser’s built-in support for automation, although not all browsers have official support for remote control.

WebDriver’s aim is to emulate a real user’s interaction with the browser as closely as possible. This is possible at varying levels in different browsers.

### 4.1 Download driver
Download the driver needed for the browser you want to use in the python project.
[Here](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/driver_requirements/) you can find the links to download them.
