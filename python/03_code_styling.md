# Code Styling

The Python language has some programming guidelines outlined in PEP8  
[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## Code Lay-out  
### Indentation  
Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

### Maximum Line Length  
Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.  

For flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions (docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 72 characters.

### Blank Lines
Top-level function and classes are separated by two blank lines.  
Method definitions inside classes should be separated by one blank line.
